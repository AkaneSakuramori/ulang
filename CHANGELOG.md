# Changelog

## 1.8.0

### Added
- Self-hosting: a **full layout-aware lexer written in Ulang** (`selfhost/lexer_full.ul`),
  the first step of Stage 1 (completing the self-hosted parser). Unlike the earlier
  demonstration lexer, it produces the complete token stream — including significant
  indentation as `INDENT`/`DEDENT`/`NEWLINE`, comment handling, string skipping, and
  bracket-depth tracking — exactly as the reference lexer does.
- `test_selfhost_lexer_full.py` validates it token-for-token (including all layout tokens)
  against the Python reference lexer on all 23 example programs.

### Notes
- This lexer is the token source the self-hosted parser consumes. Implementing it required
  no new language features and surfaced no language gaps — structs as mutable lexer state,
  lists, and string indexing were sufficient.

## 1.7.0

### Added
- Self-hosting: an **expression parser written in Ulang** (`selfhost/expr_parser.ul`),
  the next compiler stage after the self-hosted lexer. It is a precedence-climbing parser
  producing a canonical AST (serialized as S-expressions) covering operator precedence and
  associativity, unary and postfix operators, function calls, indexing, attribute access,
  list literals, and ternaries.
- `test_selfhost_parser.py` validates the Ulang parser's AST against the Python reference
  parser across a 28-expression corpus, guaranteeing identical structure.

### Notes
- Implementing the parser in Ulang required no new language features, confirming the core
  language is sufficient for real compiler work. It exercises structs (as mutable parser
  state), lists, string operations, and recursion.

## 1.6.0

### Added
- Cross-platform support for Linux, macOS, and Windows (x86-64 and ARM64) with identical
  language semantics on every platform and execution engine.
  - `src/platform_abi.py`: central abstraction for executable/shared-library naming,
    FFI library resolution, relocation model, and C-compiler discovery (`ULANG_CC`).
  - `ulang build` now discovers a C compiler automatically, applies the platform's
    executable suffix, and links the portable GC runtime on every OS.
  - `platform` standard-library module (`os`, `arch`, `exe_ext`, `path_sep`, `line_sep`,
    `is_linux`/`is_macos`/`is_windows`).
  - `ulang platform` and `ulang doctor` commands.
  - Portable installer (`install.py`) producing a launcher for Unix or Windows.
  - Cross-platform CI matrix (Linux/macOS/Windows, Python 3.10 and 3.12) that also builds
    and runs a native binary on each OS.
  - Cross-platform guide (`docs/cross-platform.md`).

### Fixed
- The lexer now accepts Windows (`\r\n`) and classic-Mac (`\r`) line endings, producing
  identical tokens and output to Unix (`\n`). The formatter always writes `\n`.
- FFI library resolution is portable instead of assuming Linux `.so` names.

## 1.5.0

### Added
- Memory management: a generational, incremental mark-sweep tracing garbage collector.
  - Interpreter/VM: tracks lists, dicts, tuples, structs, enum variants, and closures;
    roots are globals and the live call stack; collection runs at statement safepoints.
    Reclaims cycles that reference counting cannot. Off by default (zero overhead);
    enable with `ULANG_GC=1` or `gc_enable()`.
  - Native backend: every binary links and initializes a C mark-sweep collector
    (`runtime/ulang_gc.c`), unit-tested in `runtime/test_gc.c`.
  - Built-ins `gc_enable`, `gc_disable`, `gc_collect`, `gc_alloc_count`, `gc_live_count`,
    and the `ulang gc-stats` command.
  - Memory management guide (`docs/memory.md`) and `bench/memory_benchmark.py`.
- Program output is identical with the collector on or off; existing code is unaffected.

## 1.4.0

### Added
- Compiler optimizations (behavior-preserving, on by default, `ULANG_NO_OPT=1` to
  disable): constant folding and propagation through immutable bindings, dead-branch and
  dead-loop elimination, algebraic identities, constant string folding, and a bytecode
  peephole pass. Verified to produce identical output on the interpreter and VM.
- Self-hosting progress: a complete lexer written in Ulang (`selfhost/lexer.ul`) whose
  output is conformance-tested against the reference lexer.
- Package manager: `ulang install`, `add`, `remove`, `update`, `publish`, `search`,
  and `list`. Manifests (`ulang.toml`), lockfiles (`ulang.lock`) for reproducible
  builds, semantic-version constraints (`^`, `~`, ranges), a dependency resolver with
  conflict detection, and a content-addressed registry with SHA-256 verification.
- `import <package>` loads installed packages from `ulang_modules/`.
- Package management guide in `docs/packages.md`.
- Language Server Protocol implementation (`ulang lsp`): diagnostics, hover,
  completion, go-to-definition, document symbols, and formatting over JSON-RPC.
- VS Code extension in `editors/vscode` with a TextMate grammar for highlighting.
- Editor setup guide covering VS Code, Neovim, and other LSP clients.

## 1.0.0

First stable release. The complete toolchain is in place: source to native code,
with development engines for fast iteration.

### Language
- Static typing with type inference and no-null semantics (`Option`, `Result`, `?`).
- Immutable-by-default bindings (`let` / `var`).
- Records (`type`), sum types (`enum`), traits, and generics with bounds.
- Exhaustive pattern matching.
- First-class functions, closures, lambdas, and string interpolation.
- Structured concurrency (`nursery`, `spawn`, channels).
- C foreign-function interface (`extern fn`).

### Toolchain
- Lexer, parser, and static type checker.
- Tree-walking interpreter.
- Bytecode compiler and stack virtual machine.
- REPL.
- Native backend via LLVM producing standalone executables.
- Tiered JIT that compiles hot functions to native code at runtime.
- Escape analysis for stack vs heap allocation.
- Standard library: `fs`, `json`, `math`, `time`, `str`, `random`, `list`.
- Formatter (`ulang fmt`) and project scaffolding (`ulang init`).

### Verified
- 9 test suites covering every stage.
- Native and JIT output verified identical to the interpreter.
- Bytecode VM output verified identical to the interpreter.
- Self-hosting: a Ulang tokenizer tokenizes Ulang source.
- Benchmarks: JIT ~1700x over the interpreter on recursive workloads;
  native in the millisecond range.
