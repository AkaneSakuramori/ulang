# Ulang

[![CI](https://github.com/AkaneSakuramori/ulang/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/AkaneSakuramori/ulang/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Ulang is a compiled, statically-typed programming language with type inference,
structured concurrency, and a clean, readable syntax. It compiles to native code,
runs without a global interpreter lock, and treats errors as values.

> Status: **2.0.0** — first stable release. A self-hosted compiler pipeline with a validated bootstrap, exercised by a suite of real-world programs; cross-platform, four execution engines (interpreter, VM, JIT, native), garbage collector, package manager, and LSP.

## Features

- Static typing with type inference and no-null enforcement (`Option`/`Result`).
- Immutable bindings by default (`let`), explicit mutability (`var`).
- Algebraic data types (`enum`) with exhaustive pattern matching.
- Errors as values with the `?` propagation operator.
- Traits for polymorphism and generics with bounds.
- First-class functions, closures, and string interpolation.
- Structured concurrency: nurseries, tasks, and channels.
- C FFI: call native libraries directly with `extern fn`.
- Four execution engines: interpreter, bytecode VM, tiered JIT, and native (LLVM).
- Editor support via a built-in Language Server (`ulang lsp`).
- Package manager with reproducible builds and verified downloads (`ulang install`).
- Generational tracing garbage collector across the interpreter, VM, and native runtime.
- Cross-platform: identical semantics on Linux, macOS, and Windows (x86-64 and ARM64).
- Tooling: formatter, project scaffolding, and a standard library.

## Example

```ulang
type User:
    id: int
    name: str
    email: str?
derive(Display)

fn greet(u: User) -> str:
    match u.email:
        Some(e) => "${u.name} <${e}>"
        None    => u.name

fn main():
    let u = User(1, "ada", none)
    print(greet(u))
```

## Concurrency

Concurrency is structured: tasks live inside a `nursery` scope that does not exit until
all of its children finish.

```ulang
fn main():
    with nursery() as g:
        let a = g.spawn(() => fetch(1))
        let b = g.spawn(() => fetch(2))
        print(a.await() + b.await())
```

Channels pass values between tasks:

```ulang
let ch = channel()
ch.send(42)
print(ch.recv())
```

## Foreign functions

`extern fn` binds a C library function and calls it directly:

```ulang
extern fn sqrt(x: float) -> float from "m"

fn main():
    print(sqrt(16.0))
```

## Execution engines

The same program runs on four engines that share a frontend and produce identical
results:

- **Interpreter** — tree-walking; simplest, used for development.
- **Bytecode VM** — compiles to bytecode for a stack machine; drives the REPL.
- **Tiered JIT** — the interpreter counts calls and compiles hot numeric functions to
  native code at runtime via LLVM, then swaps them in.
- **Native** — ahead-of-time compilation to a standalone executable.

```sh
ulang run   file.ul      # interpreter
ulang runvm file.ul      # bytecode VM
ulang jit   file.ul      # tiered JIT
ulang build file.ul -o a && ./a   # native
```

### Benchmarks

Indicative timings (single machine; all engines produce identical output):

| Benchmark            | Interpreter | Bytecode VM | JIT     | Native  |
|----------------------|-------------|-------------|---------|---------|
| `fib(30)`            | ~20 s       | ~13 s       | ~16 ms  | ~5 ms   |
| `count_primes(20k)`  | ~2.0 s      | ~1.8 s      | ~91 ms  | ~2.5 ms |
| `loop_sum(3M)`       | ~5.5 s      | ~9.3 s      | ~5.7 s  | ~2.8 ms |

Other tracked metrics: interpreter startup ~45 ms, native `fib` binary ~16.7 KB. Run the
runtime benchmarks with `python3 bench/benchmark.py` and the toolchain metrics with
`python3 bench/metrics.py`; full results and methodology are in
[docs/benchmarks.md](docs/benchmarks.md).

## Self-hosting

Ulang is progressing toward a self-hosted compiler — the Ulang compiler written in Ulang
itself, in [`selfhost/compiler/`](selfhost/compiler/). It is built one compiler stage at a
time; each stage is validated for identical behavior against the Python reference in
[`src/`](src/) before the next begins.

- **Stage 1 — Parsing: complete.**
  - `selfhost/compiler/lexer.ul` — source text to a token stream, including significant
    indentation (`INDENT`/`DEDENT`/`NEWLINE`), verified token-for-token against the
    reference lexer on every example program.
  - `selfhost/compiler/parser.ul` — token stream to a syntax tree, covering every language
    construct (modules, functions, types, enums, traits, `impl` blocks, generics with
    bounds, all statements and control flow, pattern matching, lambdas, and the full
    expression grammar). Its syntax trees are verified **identical to the reference
    parser** across all example programs plus a stress corpus, and it terminates cleanly
    on malformed input.
- **Stage 2 — Semantic analysis: complete.** The self-hosted semantic analyzer reproduces
  every rule the reference compiler performs, each proven equivalent:
  - `selfhost/compiler/checker.ul` — name resolution, type inference/checking, pattern
    validation, and match exhaustiveness checking.
  - `selfhost/compiler/exports.ul` — visibility / package exports (a module's public API).
  - `selfhost/compiler/consteval.ul` — compile-time constant evaluation with propagation.
- **Stage 3 — Optimization and code generation: complete.**
  - `selfhost/compiler/optimizer.ul` — the reference AST optimizer's behavior-preserving
    passes, producing optimized syntax trees byte-identical to the reference.
  - `selfhost/compiler/bytecode.ul` — stack-VM bytecode generation (all control flow,
    closures, pattern dispatch, and the peephole pass), instruction-for-instruction
    identical to the reference.
  - `selfhost/compiler/codegen.ul` — native LLVM code generation for the numeric and
    control-flow core, producing binaries whose output is identical to `ulang build`.

All three self-hosting stages — parsing, semantic analysis, and optimization/code
generation — are complete, each validated against the Python reference. They are
integrated into a single compiler driver, invoked with `ulang selfhost`:

```sh
ulang selfhost program.ul            # compile via the self-hosted pipeline (bytecode)
ulang selfhost program.ul --native   # emit native LLVM IR (numeric/control-flow core)
```

The bootstrap — the Python reference building and running the Ulang compiler, and the
Ulang compiler compiling its own source — is validated end to end
(`tests/test_bootstrap.py`, 150/150). See [docs/bootstrapping.md](docs/bootstrapping.md)
for the full bootstrap process and the current state of self-hosting.

## Software built in Ulang

Eleven reference programs in [`projects/`](projects/) are written entirely in Ulang and
validate the language on real work. Each runs identically on the interpreter and the
bytecode VM and is compiled by the self-hosted compiler; all are pinned by
`tests/test_projects.py`.

| Project | Domain |
|---|---|
| [`calc`](projects/calc/) | Arithmetic expression evaluator (lexer, precedence parser, evaluator) |
| [`lisp`](projects/lisp/) | A small Lisp interpreter — reader, environments, closures, recursion |
| [`kvstore`](projects/kvstore/) | In-memory key/value store with a command language |
| [`rpn`](projects/rpn/) | RPN calculator with typed error handling (`Result`, `?`) |
| [`jsonfmt`](projects/jsonfmt/) | JSON value model and pretty-printer (recursive enums) |
| [`graph`](projects/graph/) | Breadth-first shortest paths on a directed graph |
| [`stats`](projects/stats/) | Numerical statistics toolkit (mean, variance, median) |
| [`wordstats`](projects/wordstats/) | Word-frequency and text statistics |
| [`table`](projects/table/) | Aligned text-table formatter |
| [`report`](projects/report/) | CSV report generator with file I/O |
| [`life`](projects/life/) | Conway's Game of Life |

Building these surfaced genuine gaps that were fixed in the language and standard library
(comparator `sort`, string `substring`/`index_of`/`repeat`, additional `math` functions, a
higher recursion limit, and a self-hosted-lexer fix for nested string interpolation). The
full record is in [docs/2.0-findings.md](docs/2.0-findings.md).

```sh
cp path/to/program.ul input.ul
ulang run selfhost/compiler/lexer.ul     # token stream for input.ul
ulang run selfhost/compiler/parser.ul    # syntax tree (S-expressions) for input.ul
```

## Optimizations

The compiler applies behavior-preserving optimizations to every execution engine:

- **Constant folding** — compile-time evaluation of constant expressions, using the same
  arithmetic as the runtime so results are identical.
- **Constant propagation** — immutable `let`/`const` bindings are substituted and folded.
- **Dead-code elimination** — branches with constant conditions, `while false` loops, and
  unreachable code are removed.
- **Algebraic identities** — `x + 0`, `x * 1`, and similar simplifications.
- **String folding** — constant concatenation and interpolation are precomputed.
- **Bytecode peephole** — redundant jumps and unreachable instructions are removed.

Optimizations are on by default; set `ULANG_NO_OPT=1` to disable them.

## Standard library

Modules available via `import`: `fs`, `json`, `math`, `time`, `str`, `random`, `list`.

## Tooling

```sh
ulang init myapp          # scaffold a project (ulang.toml + src/main.ul)
ulang add greeter         # add a dependency and install it
ulang install             # install dependencies from the lockfile
ulang update              # re-resolve to the newest allowed versions
ulang publish             # publish the current package to the registry
ulang search json         # search the registry
ulang fmt file.ul         # print canonical formatting
ulang fmt file.ul -w      # format in place
ulang escape file.ul      # show stack vs heap allocation analysis
ulang lsp                 # start the language server for editors
```

Package management is described in [docs/packages.md](docs/packages.md); editor
integration in [docs/editor-setup.md](docs/editor-setup.md).

## Getting started

Ulang is under active development. The toolchain builds from source and runs on
Python 3.10+.

```sh
# tokenize a source file
python3 src/ulang.py lex examples/01_hello.ul

# parse a source file to an AST
python3 src/ulang.py parse examples/01_hello.ul

# type-check a source file
python3 src/ulang.py check examples/09_result.ul

# run with the tree-walking interpreter
python3 src/ulang.py run examples/08_enums_match.ul

# run with the bytecode virtual machine
python3 src/ulang.py runvm examples/08_enums_match.ul

# compile to a native executable via LLVM, then run it
python3 src/ulang.py build examples/native/fib.ul -o fib
./fib

# print the generated LLVM IR
python3 src/ulang.py emit-ir examples/native/fib.ul

# start the interactive REPL
python3 src/ulang.py repl

# run the full test suite
python3 tests/run_all.py
```

The native backend requires `llvmlite` and a C toolchain (`gcc`):

```sh
pip install llvmlite
```

It currently compiles the numeric and control-flow core (`int`, `float`, `bool`,
functions, recursion, `if`/`while`/`for`, and `print`) to a standalone binary.
Heap types and closures run on the interpreter and VM today and are added to the
native backend alongside the runtime and memory model (Step 8).

## Toolchain

The compiler is organized as a classic pipeline:

```
source → lexer → parser → checker → ┬→ interpreter (tree-walking)
                                     ├→ compiler → bytecode → VM
                                     └→ codegen → LLVM IR → native binary
```
